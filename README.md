# Game-Jam-theme-is-Bug


taking part in a game competition hosted by Game Off 2021 on itch.io. The theme is bug

<br>BUG'M<br>
<br>M stand for Mosquito
<br>Inspired when I live in a boarding house<br>
the concept of the game is that we as players must be able to repel mosquitoes so that humans are not exposed to mosquitoes
